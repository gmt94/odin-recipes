            </ul>
        </p>

            <strong>Directions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, combine all-purpose flour, cake flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. Whisk together. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, add light brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk together with a hand mixer on medium speed until light and airy. While whisking, slowly stream in the butter. Once combined, add in the eggs one at a time followed by the egg yolks</li>
                <li>Once the butter sugar, and egg mixture is smooth, switch to a rubber spatula and fold in the dry ingredients until the dough forms.
                </li>
                <li>Add in rough chopped walnuts and chopped chocolate. Mix until combined. Cover and let the dough rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Remove from fridge. Scoop out a large dough ball. Weigh each dough ball out to 6oz and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. About ten equal sized balls.
                </li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap, and let chill in the fridge at least 12 hours, up to 48.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 (375F convection). Remove cookie dough from fridge. Space each cookie about 2-3 inches apart from each other on a parchment lined baking tray. Immediately place in preheated oven and bake for 13-15 minutes. Or until the edges are golden, but the middle is still slightly gooey. Set tray on a wire rack to cool at least 1 hour before serving.
                </li>
            </ol>
